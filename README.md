# CP1404 Practicals Repository

This repository contains my completed practical work for **CP1404 Programming II** at James Cook University.  
It demonstrates implementations of programming concepts including object-oriented design, clean code principles, and Python best practices.

## Clean Code Principles Learned
Key lessons about writing maintainable code:
- **Intentional Naming**  
  Use self-documenting identifiers like `student_enrollment_list` instead of generic names like `data`
- **Single Responsibility**  
  Design functions to perform one focused task (e.g., separate data loading from processing)
- **Consistent Style**  
  Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines using PyCharm's reformat tool (`Ctrl+Alt+L`)
- **Effective Commenting**  
  Write _why_ comments for complex logic, not _what_ descriptions
