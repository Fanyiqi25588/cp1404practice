What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve become more focused on breaking tasks down into smaller steps, which helps me manage my time better. 
I’ve learned to prioritize tasks based on deadlines and complexity, which has reduced stress.
Additionally, I’ve become better at seeking clarification early when I don’t fully understand an assignment or concept, instead of trying to figure it out all on my own.
What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve on managing my time efficiently, particularly when working on larger assignments or projects. 
I sometimes spend too much time on minor details and end up rushing through other parts. 
I need to set stricter time limits for different tasks and stick to them more consistently. 
I also plan to adopt a more proactive approach, ensuring that I engage with the course material consistently rather than leaving things until the last minute.

What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been consistent with watching the lecture videos and taking notes, which has helped me understand the material better.
I’ve also developed a good habit of practicing coding regularly, which has improved my problem-solving skills. 
Keeping track of my progress with tasks and sticking to a routine has also been helpful, and I want to continue this.

What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop overthinking certain problems, especially when I get stuck. 
I’ve found that sometimes I waste time trying to solve a problem in one go instead of breaking it down and tackling it in stages.
I also need to stop procrastinating on reading ahead and focus more on applying what I’ve learned immediately, instead of waiting until I feel "ready."

What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I’d suggest incorporating more interactive learning resources, such as coding exercises or group projects, where students can collaborate and get immediate feedback. 
This could help solidify concepts more effectively and give students opportunities to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. 
It would also be helpful to have more opportunities for practical work outside of assignments, where we can work on self-directed projects or experiment with new tools and techniques.
